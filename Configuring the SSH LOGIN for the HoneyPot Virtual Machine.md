I created a the KeyPair file (Public and Private) using the this command : <img width="348" height="23" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bce99d7-f2ab-4d2e-b8b5-258ed2f26ec1" /> <br>
which was saved on my Local Host (PC) and then I used this command to locate and view my Public Key <br>

I then copied the Public key, Mine looked like this <img width="864" height="21" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8521d329-5ace-4432-a7ae-cd126887b23c" /> <br> and Pasted it into my ~/.ssh/authorized_keys Folder in my HoneyPot Virtual Machine. 

I dont think I had the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys folder available so i had to create the Folder using this command from my terminal
